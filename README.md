# 15-minute-analysis
Hi!! Please edit and add to this as needed! - Cara

## Proposal

Background:  In a 15-minute city, residents have easy access to destinations that are considered to be the minimum standards of living. This includes education, healthcare, and food-related services. These communities are able to walk, ride a bike, or use public transportation to get to such urban functions within 15 minutes. According to these standards, residents are able to grow, learn, and live a content lifestyle by promoting healthy and sustainable commuting practices.

## Objective: Comparative 15 Minute City Analysis of San Diego and Washington D.C.

## Data:
population data, income data, locations (hospitals, schools, grocery stores, transportation, green spaces / parks, religious establishments)

## Workflow: 
Write and submit proposal.

Find data.

Import datasets in Jupyterhub.

Clean up US data to show SD and DC schools and hospital locations only.

Determine city/population center using pointpattern method and find the mean center

Create buffer using population center of SD and DC. Analyze our findings to see what areas include or lack the minimum standards of living.
